Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
  - An method used to mitigate bias problems
  - When an experiment is conducted, test subjects should be drawn randomly. As such, Randomized Control Trial (RCT) is the best way to get reliable results.
  - This is unviable in the real world, such as in clinical trials where subject distribution are bound to be biased. We cannot, for example, assgin random treatments to patients with varying conditions and degrees.
  - Thus we use PSM to alleviate possible convariances with Y (the independent variable) and \[ X_1..n \] (dependent variables)
